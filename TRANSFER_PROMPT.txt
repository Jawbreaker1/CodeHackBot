CodeHackBot handoff prompt for Kali

You are continuing work in the CodeHackBot repo on branch main.

Current state:
- Sprint 35 benchmark harness is implemented.
- `birdhackbot-orchestrator benchmark` exists and writes scorecards/summary/baseline.
- Interrupt handling was fixed: Ctrl-C now cancels the full benchmark loop and writes partial summary.
- Latest commits:
  - c52ecde fix: stop benchmark loop on interrupt and write partial summary
  - 64f8155 feat: add orchestrator benchmark harness and role-focused UX docs

Important context:
- Work only within authorized internal lab scope.
- Avoid customer/third-party targets.
- Keep sprint structure strict.

Immediate validation goal on Kali:
1) Build:
   - go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/birdhackbot
   - go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/birdhackbot-orchestrator
2) Run a small benchmark smoke first:
   - ./birdhackbot-orchestrator benchmark --sessions-dir sessions --worker-cmd ./birdhackbot --worker-arg worker --repeat 1 --seed 42 --scenario host_discovery_inventory --approval-timeout 2m
3) If smoke is healthy, run full baseline:
   - ./birdhackbot-orchestrator benchmark --sessions-dir sessions --worker-cmd ./birdhackbot --worker-arg worker --repeat 5 --seed 42 --lock-baseline --approval-timeout 2m

If benchmark appears stuck:
- Check status:
  - ./birdhackbot-orchestrator status --sessions-dir sessions --run <run-id>
- Check approvals:
  - ./birdhackbot-orchestrator approvals --sessions-dir sessions --run <run-id>
- Tail events:
  - tail -n 40 sessions/<run-id>/orchestrator/event/event.jsonl

After baseline run:
- Report median/P90 metrics and any blockers.
- If needed, prioritize next hardening within Sprint 35 before moving to Sprint 36.
